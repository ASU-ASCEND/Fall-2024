/*
  SD card file dump

  This example shows how to read a file from the SD card using the
  SD library and send it over the serial port.

  The circuit:
   SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
   ** MISO - pin 4
   ** MOSI - pin 7
   ** CS   - pin 5
   ** SCK  - pin 6

  // Open serial communications and wait for port to open:
  Serial.begin(115200);

  // Ensure the SPI pinout the SD card is connected to is configured properly
  SPI.setRX(_MISO);
  SPI.setTX(_MOSI);
  SPI.setSCK(_SCK);

  // see if the card is present and can be initialized:
  if (!SD.begin(_CS)) {
    Serial.println("Card failed, or not present");
    // don't do anything more:
    return;
  }
  Serial.println("card initialized.");

  // open the file. note that only one file can be open at a time,
  // so you have to close this one before opening another.

  // if the file is available, write to it:

  }
  // if the file isn't open, pop up an error:
  else {
