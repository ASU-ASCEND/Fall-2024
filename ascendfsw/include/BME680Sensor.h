/**
 * @class BME680Sensor
 * @brief A class to interface with the Adafruit BME680 sensor for environmental
 * data collection.
 *
 * The BME680Sensor class is responsible for interacting with the BME680 sensor
 * to gather environmental data such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and gas
 * resistance. It also provides an approximation of altitude based on sea level
 * pressure.
 *
 * This class inherits from the Sensor base class and overrides its virtual
 * methods to implement the specific functionality required to read and verify
 * data from the BME680 sensor.
 *
 * Key functionalities:
 * - Verify sensor connection and setup.
 * - Retrieve sensor readings in CSV format for easy integration with data
 * logging systems.
 * - Get sensor name and CSV header for consistency in data handling.
