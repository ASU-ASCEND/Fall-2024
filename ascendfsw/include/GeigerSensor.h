/**
 * @class GeigerSensor
 * @brief A class for interfacing with a Geiger counter sensor.
 * 
 * The GeigerSensor class is responsible for measuring counts per second (CPS) 
 * from a Geiger counter to detect radiation levels. This class utilizes an interrupt 
 * to increment the count whenever radiation particles are detected by the sensor.
 * 
 * Key functionalities:
 * - Attaches an interrupt to the sensor pin to track counts.
 * - Reads the current CPS value over a set period and provides the data in CSV format.
 * - Provides functionality to verify the sensor connection and reset counts after each reading.
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * ```
 * GeigerSensor sensor;
 * if (sensor.verify()) {
 *     String data = sensor.readData();
 * }
 * ```
 *
