/**
 * @class INA260Sensor
 * @brief A class to interface with the Adafruit INA260 sensor for current,
 * voltage, and power measurements.
 *
 * The INA260Sensor class is responsible for interacting with the Adafruit
 * INA260 sensor to gather electrical data, including current (in mA), voltage
 * (in mV), and power (in mW). This class inherits from the Sensor base class
 * and overrides the `verify()` and `readData()` methods to provide specific
 * functionality for the INA260 sensor.
 *
 * Key functionalities:
 * - Initializes and verifies the connection with the INA260 sensor.
 * - Reads current, voltage, and power data from the sensor and returns it in
 * CSV format.
